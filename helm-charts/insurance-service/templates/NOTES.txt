Congratulations, you have deployed {{ .Chart.Name }} to Kubernetes using Helm!

To verify your application is running, run the following commands to tunnel the port of the pod :


Fetching name of the pod which is deployed in Kubernetes Cluster. If it throws `list index out of range`, it means that no pod associated to the {{ .Chart.Name }} was found.

kubectl get pod -n default -l app={{ .Chart.Name }} -o json | python -c 'import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)["items"][0]["metadata"]["name"]'


If previous query runs well, and we obtain the complete pod name. Let's run the command below right afterwards, to set POD_NAME env to output of previous command.

export POD_NAME=$(!!)


Now, tunnel to the port where the application is running in the pod to localhost:8080

kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:{{ .Values.containerPort }}


Finally, open your web browser to http://localhost:8080 or run the following from command line, eg:

open http://localhost:8080
